# JavaScript Real-Time Multi Chart Dashboard

![JavaScript Real-Time Multi Chart Dashboard](manyCharts-darkGold.png)

This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

-   Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
-   Open the project folder in a terminal:

          npm install              # fetches dependencies
          npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

-   The application is available at _http://localhost:8080_ in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

Showcase of 100 different LightningChart visuals all in one scene as completely individual components.

Each channel is receiving streaming data in real-time and displaying it as fast as possible.

While in this example the layout looks like a inflexible grid where every chart has the same size, this is technically not the case.
In technical terms every chart is a completely independent component, which could be dragged around, resized, removed, added in, etc. at any point in time.

Details:

-   Number of charts: 100
-   Stream rate per channel: 60 points per second
-   Time window: 10 seconds
-   Total data points displayed at any given time: 600 000
-   Total data points streamed every second: 6 000
-   Refresh rate: 60 times per second\*

\*Depends on monitor, usually with PC monitors / laptops capped at 60 Hz. Mobile devices / laptops sometimes have higher refresh rates.
Additionally on weak hardware update rate can drop, generally due to weaker GPU.
